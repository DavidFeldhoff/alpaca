# Access to and setup of the Power App

One of the client technologies that give you access to COSMO Alpaca is the Power Platform. We currently have one Power Apps for project management and for container management.

## Start and setup

1. Go to the [PowerApps Portal](https://make.powerapps.com/), log in and get started. You can skip the request asking for contact information and go straight to the Apps on the left.
1. Open the **COSMO Alpaca** PowerApp with a click. You may need to confirm the start of the trial plan.
1. The app will ask you to allow them access to the backend. Click on **Sign In** next to all connectors.
