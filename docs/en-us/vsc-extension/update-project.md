# Update the project configuration

The projects created via the COSMO Alpaca are using configurations and secrets like for example licenses or credentials for creating Business Central images based on insider artifacts. Those secrets regularly change e.g. when a license expires. To use the newest configuration and secrets for your project, do the following steps:

1. In the Visual Studio Code extension right click on a project and choose **Update variables/licenses**.
1. When the variables and licenses were successfully updated, you'll get a notification about the success.
